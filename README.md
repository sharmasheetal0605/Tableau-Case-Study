# Superstore Sales Dashboard

This project involves the creation of an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze and visualize sales data for a global superstore. The dashboard addresses key business questions aimed at increasing sales, optimizing profits, and identifying potential expansion opportunities. The analysis is focused on three specific case studies:

Case 2: Impact of Discounts on Sales and Profit
In this analysis, the relationship between discount strategies and their effects on sales and profit is explored. Key insights include:
- Whether offering more discounts leads to higher sales.
- The effect of discounts on overall profitability.
- How product variety and market size influence sales growth.

Case 3: Sales Seasonality Analysis
This case focuses on analyzing the seasonality of sales. The dashboard provides insights into how sales fluctuate across different seasons (e.g., Summer and Winter) and highlights two specific products that experience significant sales variation due to seasonal changes.

Case 4: Global Expansion and Profit Maximization
In this analysis, geographic sales data is used to identify regions where the superstore should consider expanding to maximize profits. The dashboard offers a clear picture of which global markets present the most potential for future growth.
